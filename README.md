# Half-Life: Alyx non VR mod (driver)
First driver allows to complete [Half-Life: Alyx](https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/) without VR on keyboard and mouse. This method allows to complete the game and try out VR mechanics. Some moments will make you sweat, but they are passable in this way. Also, this method allows you to get a very interesting and unusual gameplay (sometimes similar to Amnesia or Penumbra), which unfortunately almost never happens in ordinary games. I went through the game in VR and went through it that way, and I find both experiences very interesting.

## Walkthrough difficulties
• **Chapter 3: Is Or Will Be (fix the wheel)**

First you need to pull the pipe out of the wheel. Then go down a bit using the "PageDown" button. Scroll the wheel with RShift and look. After the necessary rotation, fix the hand using the " ' " button. Holding "RShift" and " ' ", raise the pipe in your right hand (left mouse button). Still holding all three buttons, slightly tilt the pipe down using the "J" button, and then insert the pipe using the "Insert" button (forward controllers move). The whole process of walkthrough this moment can be seen in [this video](https://youtu.be/70ok-78S2pA).



• **Chapter 4: Superweapon (throw grenade into the ventilation)**

You can simply put the grenade up by using the "PageUP" buttons and go down then by pressing the "Numpad -" button.



• **Chapter 5: North star (power off)**

First you need to use rotation ("U", "J", "H", "K"), then reset ("Y"), then raise the lever (left and right mouse button + look up or Insert and Home) and lock the controller (" ' "). The process of walkthrough this moment can be seen in [this video](https://youtu.be/K9PDUqsrAbQ?t=85).



• **Chapter 6: the arms Race (lasers)**

For lasers, you must use the separate mode ("L"). Move up, down, right and left with the mouse, and move forward and back with the buttons (up, down). Laser clearance can be seen in [this video](https://youtu.be/Xj0bpAArUaE?t=11).



• **Chapter 7: Jeff (opening the bunker)**

This requires training and patience. First you need to lower the lever (grab the lever in the mode of movement of the left controller (left and right mouse button) and move it down ("}")), then turn 2 cells, first you need to pull it up a little and turn it (use the view and the rotation buttons ("U", "J", "H", "K") or "Backspace"), then you only need to lower the last lever down. Grab the lever in the mode of movement of the left hand (left and right mouse buttons), look down and click the button for moving the controllers down ("}"). The entire process of walkthrough this moment can be seen in [this video](https://youtu.be/Xj0bpAArUaE?t=71). 



• **Chapter 10: Breaking and entering (battle with the spider)**

We grab the weapon with the right controller and direct it towards the spider, higher. Next, in the mode, grab the reload lever and move it up and down, one at a time (by looking at or using the buttons for moving the controllers up and down "{" ,"}", in the mode for moving the left controller, the left and right mouse buttons). It is extremely important to aim the weapon higher to get into the final ball launched by the spider.



• **Not enough health**

If you are stuck and can't pass one of the hard moments, then you can use the immortality cheat code. To do this, you need to launch the game from the console. Add the launch parameters to the game `-allowdebug -vconport 29000 -vcon -console`, enter `sv_cheats 1` and then `god`, after which you will be immortal and easily pass the difficult moments. Do not forget to disable the immortality mode after walkthrough a difficult place by entering the `god` command again.



Also [saves are also available](https://github.com/r57zone/Half-Life-Alyx-novr/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ASaves) to skip difficult moments of the game.
## Problems
**Red screen** - switch the focus to the game "Half-Life: Alyx" via ALT + TAB, press the left mouse button and then switch back to the "Headset window". You can also change the "DebugMode" parameter to true, in the "default.vrsettings" configuration file, if there are any problems with the red screen. Minimize all SteamVR notifications so they don’t interfere.



**Headset is not monitored** - this happens when the "Headset Window" is out of focus, you need to select this window through ALT + TAB. In the SteamVR settings, you can put the option not to turn off the display for 5 minutes. The helmet will begin to be tracked as soon as you switch to the "Headset Window".



**Buttons do not work or high sensitivity** - start SteamVR first and only then the game.



**Hands don't move** - switch to the "Headset Window" and click the left mouse button.



**Using WASD** - the "S" button is used SteamVR, so I had to use the arrows.



**Large viewing angle** - it can be changed [this way](https://youtu.be/wsJl_ODPSPI) or [this way](https://youtu.be/8f_2GkruPdU).



**Black corners** - they can partially be removed [this way](https://youtu.be/wsJl_ODPSPI).



**SteamVR Home** - automatic start can be disabled in the SteamVR settings.



**The game or SteamVR don't start** - restart the computer or close Steam, SteamVR and the game in the task manager, if any.
